TamedCaller
===========
### Turn your wildest requests into well-behaved little calls.

Tame complex call requirements and rate limits, mix and match polling and instant requests with caching, queues and throttle, all with a simple, reliable API.

Still in beta, much as a proof-of-concept, but it works pretty well already. Test coverage will come as soon as possible so that you don't need to believe me (but that may take a while).
